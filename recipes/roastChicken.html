<p>I made this chicken exactly as stated, no changes. One of the best roast chickens I've ever made. Our family ate the whole. darn. bird. There was nothing leftover. Next time, I will double the recipe as I think this would be great picked apart for chicken sandwiches. NOTE: I served this with Pioneer Woman's Crash Hot Potatoes and a simple vegetable platter. This was a very inexpensive meal to make but comforting and satisfying all the same.</p>
<p>Excellent recipe - I did two organic chickens in a large roasting pan. One I seasoned as directed - the other I stuffed with the onion and celery but used another seasoning mix. They were both delicious but the original recipe chicken won the taste taste. The bones are roasting as I speak - I see some good broth in my future.</p>
<p>I've cooked my chickens and turkeys breast side down for years. The reason this works is the dark meat on the legs and bottom of the bird is denser and takes longer to cook than the white breast. Upside down, the dark meat is in the higher, hotter part of the oven (heat rises). Unwrap your chicken or turkey and leave it in the fridge over night to dry the skin and then rub your favorite fat and spices into the skin. Then there's no need to baste!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>½ onion, coarsely chopped</li>
<li>1 stalk celery, cut into 4 pieces</li>
<li>½ lemon, cut into 4 pieces</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li> oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).

<li>Remove giblet packet from cavity of chicken and pat bird thoroughly dry with paper towels. Place 1 tablespoon butter into chicken cavity, sprinkle salt and black pepper into cavity, and stuff cavity with onion, celery, and lemon pieces. Loosen skin over breast and thigh of chicken with your fingers and insert garlic slices under the skin. Place the chicken breast side up on a rack set into a roasting pan.</li>

<li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; add dried parsley and Italian seasoning. Pour half the butter-herb mixture over the chicken and rub the seasoned butter onto all parts of chicken. Reserve remaining butter mixture.</li>

<li>Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then remove and turn chicken so breast side is down. Pour remaining half of seasoned butter over the chicken, brushing it over all parts of the bird. Return to oven and roast an additional 10 minutes.</li>

<li>Reduce oven heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Roast chicken until skin is crisp and brown and the juices run clear, 1 hour and 20 more minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh, not touching bone, should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let chicken rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
