<p>This is delicious. I made it with zucchini the first time because I bought a bad eggplant. I also used veggie broth and shrimp. It was great with eggplant as well.</p>
<p>This was delicious! I wanted more veggies so I added broccoli to the curry. Nice job! We have curries all the time and this one was just as delicious. PS, I added a bit more curry paste because 2/3 of a box of chicken broth worried me that it would be too thin on taste... Thank you!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> 2 cups water</li>
<li>1 cup uncooked jasmine rice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 onion, cut into wedges</li>
<li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
<li>1 pound chicken tenders, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
<li>1 tablespoon green curry paste, or more to taste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
<li>1 eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
<li>â…” (32 ounce) carton chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
<li>1 (15 ounce) can light coconut milk</li>
<li>1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots</li>
<li>2 teaspoons lime juice</li>
<li>1 small bunch fresh basil leaves, or to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li> water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

<li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Mix in onion, fish sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic; cook and stir about 5 minutes. Add chicken, curry paste, and basil. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes more. Add eggplant, cover, and reduce heat to low to avoid burning spices. Cook about 5 minutes more.</li>

<li>Pour broth, coconut milk, and bamboo shoots into the saucepan. Continue cooking until eggplant is tender and curry is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes more. Stir in lime juice before serving over cooked rice with basil leaves.</li>
